npm start: Runs the app in development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser. The page will reload automatically when you make changes, and any lint errors will appear in the console.

npm test: Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.
See the running tests section for more details.

npm run build: Builds the app for production in the build folder.
It optimizes React for the best performance, minifies the code, and includes hashed filenames for cache optimization. Your app is then ready to be deployed!
